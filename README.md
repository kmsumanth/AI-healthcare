MedPredict - AI-Driven Healthcare Risk Prediction System

📌 Project Overview

MedPredict is an AI-driven healthcare risk prediction system designed to help hospitals predict disease risks based on patient records. By leveraging machine learning and big data technologies, MedPredict enables early intervention and improves patient outcomes.

🎯 Business Use Case

A hospital network wants to predict disease risks using electronic health records (EHR) to facilitate early diagnosis and proactive healthcare planning.

🏗️ Architecture & Workflow

Azure Data Factory: Extracts electronic health records from multiple hospital systems.

Azure Data Lake: Stores structured and unstructured patient data securely.

AWS Glue: Processes and cleans medical data for further analysis.

Databricks (Spark ML): Trains predictive models to assess disease risk.

Snowflake: Stores structured patient insights for hospital reporting.

BI Tools (Power BI, Tableau): Visualizes patient risk trends for decision-making.

🔧 Tech Stack

Data Extraction: Azure Data Factory

Storage: Azure Data Lake, Snowflake

Data Processing: AWS Glue

Machine Learning: Databricks (Spark MLlib)

BI & Analytics: Power BI, Tableau

Infrastructure: Azure, AWS, Snowflake
